           On Josh Leaving Twitter -  
        </h2>
        <div class="divBody">
I recently watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PiDJEZS2Xs">software engineer YouTuber</a> talk about why he left his job at Twitter and moved to Robinhood. 
One of the main reasons he had was that he felt like he wasn't growing along with the company since Twitter was already so well established. This is important for me to know that I shouldn't let either my or my company's limits hinder my growth as a developer.
